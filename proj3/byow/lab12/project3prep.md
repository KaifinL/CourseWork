# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:
For me 
-----

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
Well the only analogy I can tell is that they both show a way where we can put a nearly 2D demo on the screen.
-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
Well I think I will start by writing a room class and a hallway class, who were there to help create a
room or hallway for me.
-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
Well a room has much more spaces than hallways.For example a room can be a 4 * 4 rectangle.However,
it is likely that a hallway can only be a linear.
